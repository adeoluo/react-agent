"""Observability hooks for an agent run.

A run emits events as it progresses: a step begins, an action is chosen, an observation
returns, the agent finishes. :class:`Callbacks` is a small set of optional functions that
receive these events, enabling logging, metrics, tracing, or progress display without
touching the control loop. Every hook defaults to a no-op, so callers wire only what they
need.
